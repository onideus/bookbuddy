## Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Reader Profile Deletion Issue

**Problem**: Contract tests were deleting the reader profile in `beforeEach`, causing foreign key violations in subsequent tests.

**Root Cause**:
```javascript
beforeEach(async () => {
  await cleanupTestData(testReaderId); // This DELETES the reader!
});
```

**Fix**: Created new `cleanupReaderEntries()` function that removes reading entries but keeps the reader profile intact.

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/tests/helpers/test-data.js:71-80` - Added `cleanupReaderEntries()` function
- `backend/tests/helpers/test-data.js:145` - Exported new function
- `backend/tests/contract/reading-entries.test.js:9` - Imported new function
- `backend/tests/contract/reading-entries.test.js:35` - Changed cleanup call

**Code Added**:
```javascript
export async function cleanupReaderEntries(readerId) {
  // Delete reading entries and related data, but keep the reader profile
  await query('DELETE FROM progress_updates WHERE reading_entry_id IN (SELECT id FROM reading_entries WHERE reader_id = $1)', [readerId]);
  await query('DELETE FROM status_transitions WHERE reading_entry_id IN (SELECT id FROM reading_entries WHERE reader_id = $1)', [readerId]);
  await query('DELETE FROM reading_entries WHERE reader_id = $1', [readerId]);
}
```

### 2. ✅ US2 Integration Test Import Issues

**Problem**: Test was using incorrect import syntax for ES6 modules, causing "create is not a function" errors.

**Root Cause**:
```javascript
import * as ReadingService from '../../src/services/reading-service.js';
import * as Book from '../../src/models/book.js';
```

Models export classes, not namespaces, so this created namespace objects instead of the class itself.

**Fix**: Changed to named imports and fixed method call signature.

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/tests/integration/us2-track-progress.test.js:10-12` - Fixed imports
- `backend/tests/integration/us2-track-progress.test.js:42-48` - Fixed method call

**Before**:
```javascript
import * as ReadingService from '../../src/services/reading-service.js';
const entry = await ReadingService.addBook({
  readerId: testReaderId,
  title: 'Book',
  // ...
});
```

**After**:
```javascript
import { ReadingService } from '../../src/services/reading-service.js';
const result = await ReadingService.addBook(testReaderId, {
  title: 'Book',
  // ...
});
testEntryId = result.readingEntry.id;
```

## Issues Uncovered (Not Yet Fixed)

### Session/Headers Errors

**Error**: "Cannot write headers after they are sent to the client"
**Frequency**: 26 errors in latest test run
**Affected**: Contract and integration tests

**Root Cause**: The session plugin or error handler is attempting to send a response after one has already been sent. This typically happens when:
1. Error handler sends response, then session plugin tries to save session
2. Async timing issues with response lifecycle
3. Multiple response attempts in middleware chain

**Impact**: Blocking 20+ contract/integration tests from passing

**Files Affected**:
- `tests/contract/reading-entries.test.js` - Multiple uncaught exceptions
- `tests/integration/us1-organize-pipeline.test.js` - 4+ errors

**Suggested Fix**:
1. Review session plugin configuration in `src/api/middleware/session.js`
2. Ensure error handler doesn't send response if already sent
3. Check for proper async/await in middleware chain
4. Consider disabling session persistence in tests

### Remaining Unit Test Issues

**Total**: 37 failing unit tests

**Categories**:
1. **Null book_id constraints** (~10 tests) - Test setup issues
2. **Validation error mismatches** (~3 tests) - Fixed most, some remain
3. **Duplicate detection** (~2 tests) - Database constraint fires before app logic
4. **Timestamp comparisons** (~5 tests) - Potential timezone/precision issues
5. **Model return formats** (~5 tests) - Tests expect arrays, getting wrapped objects

## Test Coverage by Feature

### Working Well ✅
- Book CRUD operations (create, validate length)
- Status transitions (TO_READ → READING → FINISHED)
- Progress notes (add, retrieve, validate)
- Ratings (set, clear, retrieve top-rated)
- Reader profile management

### Needs Work ⚠️
- Session/authentication flow in API tests
- Test cleanup and isolation
- Duplicate detection error messages
- Integration test stability

## Summary

The authentication issues have been largely resolved. The primary problem was that contract tests were deleting reader profiles between tests, causing foreign key violations. By creating a dedicated cleanup function that preserves reader profiles, we fixed the root cause.

The US2 integration test import issues were also resolved by correcting the ES6 module import syntax.

The next major blocker is the session/header errors, which appear to be a timing/lifecycle issue with the Fastify session plugin. This needs investigation in the session middleware configuration.

**Net Result**: 8 more tests passing, clearer understanding of remaining issues, and better test infrastructure for future development.
