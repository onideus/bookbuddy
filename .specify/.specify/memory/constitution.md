# BookBuddy Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Quality-Driven Implementation
- Every pull request MUST pass automated linting, static analysis, and formatting checks in CI before review begins.
- Code changes MUST reference the originating spec and task IDs in the PR description and commit history to preserve traceability.
- Reviewers MUST block merges when functions exceed 40 lines or cyclomatic complexity 10 unless a documented exception is attached to the feature plan.

*Rationale: Codified engineering gates maintain a predictable baseline for readability and defect prevention.*

### II. Modular Architecture Contracts
- Features MUST be delivered as self-contained modules communicating only through documented interfaces or service contracts.
- Shared code MUST live in versioned packages; cross-module imports outside a published API are prohibited.
- Any proposal to break an existing module boundary MUST include an architecture note approved before implementation begins.

*Rationale: Explicit boundaries limit ripple effects, enabling independent delivery and safer refactoring.*

### III. Test-First Reliability
- Contributors MUST author failing automated tests before implementing or modifying functionality, following a red-green-refactor cycle.
- Each module MUST maintain ≥90% statement coverage in CI with tests covering success, failure, and boundary paths.
- Critical paths, external integrations, and user journeys MUST include contract or integration tests that run on every merge.

*Rationale: Proactive testing eliminates regressions and proves system behavior from the outset.*

### IV. Sustainable Maintainability
- Documentation, configuration, and changelogs MUST be updated within the same pull request as the code changes that require them.
- New dependencies MUST be justified in the implementation plan, pinned to explicit versions, and reviewed for license compatibility; unused dependencies MUST be removed prior to merge.
- Accepted technical debt MUST be tracked as an issue with an owner and due date not exceeding one release cycle.

*Rationale: Disciplined stewardship prevents silent drift and keeps the codebase evolvable.*

### V. Consistent User Experience
- User-facing elements MUST adhere to the BookBuddy design tokens for typography, color, spacing, and interaction states.
- Every UX change MUST document accessibility validation that meets WCAG 2.1 AA criteria.
- Copy, interaction flows, and error states MUST be reviewed against existing UX patterns; any divergence requires recorded UX approval.

*Rationale: Consistent experiences reinforce trust and reduce relearning for returning users.*

## Quality Assurance Standards

- CI pipelines MUST run linting, static analysis, unit, integration, coverage, and accessibility checks; failures block merges and releases.
- Definition of Done includes verified compliance with all five core principles, with evidence captured in the feature plan and tasks.
- Production incidents MUST trigger a retrospective documenting root cause, test coverage gaps, and remediation tasks within one sprint.

## Development Workflow

1. Write or update the feature specification, ensuring user stories include accessibility and UX acceptance criteria.
2. Produce an implementation plan that documents module boundaries, dependency impacts, and testing strategy mapped to the principles.
3. Break work into tasks grouped by user story; each task specifies required tests and documentation updates.
4. Implement via red-green-refactor, keeping commits scoped to a single task and updating documentation alongside code.
5. Secure peer review focused on principle compliance, then merge only after CI pipelines pass and UX sign-off is recorded when applicable.

## Governance

- Amendments require consensus from the engineering lead and product/UX counterparts, documented via pull request referencing impacted sections.
- Constitution version bumps follow semantic versioning: MAJOR for principle removals or incompatible rewrites, MINOR for new principles or material expansions, PATCH for clarifications that leave obligations unchanged.
- Compliance is reviewed quarterly; teams MUST log outcomes and remediation actions in the governance tracker.
