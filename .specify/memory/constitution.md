# BookBuddy Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality & Maintainability

Code MUST prioritize readability, simplicity, and long-term maintainability over cleverness or brevity.

- **Clarity First**: Code is read far more often than written. Every module, function, and variable name must clearly communicate intent without requiring inline comments to explain basic logic.
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component, service, and function must have one clear purpose. If a module requires "and" to describe its function, it should be split.
- **DRY with Judgment**: Eliminate duplication when it represents shared business logic, but tolerate minor duplication when abstraction would increase coupling or reduce clarity.
- **Dependency Minimization**: External dependencies must be justified. Each added library introduces maintenance burden, security surface, and upgrade risk.
- **Technical Debt Documentation**: When accepting technical debt (time constraints, incremental delivery), document it explicitly with owner assignment and remediation timeline (≤1 release cycle).

**Rationale**: BookBuddy must remain maintainable as it grows. Clear, simple code reduces onboarding time, bug surface area, and maintenance costs. This principle ensures the codebase remains approachable and adaptable.

### II. Testing Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Test-driven development is mandatory. Tests are written first, validated to fail, then implementation follows to make them pass.

- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Write failing test → Implement minimum code to pass → Refactor while keeping tests green.
- **Coverage Requirements**: Automated unit tests MUST achieve ≥90% statement coverage for all modules touched by a feature.
- **Test Independence**: Each test must be independently runnable and reproducible. No shared state, no test execution order dependencies.
- **Integration Testing**: Contract tests required for all API endpoints and external service boundaries. Integration tests required for critical user journeys.
- **Test as Documentation**: Tests serve as executable specifications. Acceptance scenarios from specs must map directly to integration tests.

**Rationale**: Testing is not optional. High test coverage catches regressions early, enables confident refactoring, and provides living documentation. The TDD cycle ensures we build what's needed, not what we think might be needed.

### III. User Experience Consistency

All user-facing elements MUST adhere to BookBuddy design system and meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.

- **Design Tokens**: Use shared design tokens for colors, typography, spacing, and component styles. No hardcoded values in component implementations.
- **Accessibility First**: Every interactive element must be keyboard navigable, provide visible focus indicators meeting contrast requirements, and include proper ARIA labels for screen readers.
- **Copy Guidelines**: All user-facing text follows BookBuddy tone and voice guidelines: warm, encouraging, and clear without being condescending.
- **Responsive Design**: Layouts must adapt gracefully across viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) without horizontal scrolling or content truncation.
- **Error Messaging**: Errors must be actionable, explaining what went wrong and how to fix it, using copy guidelines.

**Rationale**: Consistency builds user trust and reduces cognitive load. Accessibility is not a feature—it's a fundamental requirement. These standards ensure every user can effectively use BookBuddy regardless of ability or device.

### IV. Performance Requirements

User-perceived performance must remain fast and responsive under realistic load conditions.

- **Response Times**: UI operations (page loads, status transitions, progress updates) must complete within 3 seconds under normal network conditions.
- **Perceived Performance**: Show immediate feedback for user actions (optimistic UI updates, loading states) even when backend operations are pending.
- **Data Efficiency**: API responses should be paginated and filtered server-side. Client applications must not fetch unbounded datasets.
- **Scalability Threshold**: System must handle realistic personal library sizes (up to 5,000 books per user) without degradation.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Critical paths must be instrumented to measure actual performance against targets during testing.

**Rationale**: Users abandon slow applications. Performance must be designed in, not bolted on. These standards ensure BookBuddy remains responsive as user libraries grow.

### V. Observability & Debugging

Systems must be designed for observable behavior and efficient debugging.

- **Structured Logging**: All significant operations (state transitions, external calls, errors) must be logged with structured context (user ID, book ID, operation type, timestamp).
- **Error Context**: Exceptions must include sufficient context to reproduce the issue without accessing production data. Stack traces alone are insufficient.
- **Event Tracking**: User actions that contribute to success criteria (book additions, status changes, ratings) must emit analytics events.
- **Health Checks**: Services must expose health endpoints that validate critical dependencies (database connectivity, external APIs).
- **Local Reproducibility**: Developers must be able to reproduce production scenarios locally using logged context and test data.

**Rationale**: Bugs are inevitable. Well-instrumented systems reduce time-to-resolution from hours to minutes. Observability enables data-driven decisions about feature usage and performance bottlenecks.

## Quality Standards

### Documentation Requirements

- Feature specifications (spec.md) REQUIRED before implementation begins
- Implementation plans (plan.md) REQUIRED documenting technical decisions and architecture
- README updates REQUIRED when user-facing behavior changes
- API contracts REQUIRED for all endpoints, documented in OpenAPI/contracts directory
- Changelog updates REQUIRED for every release documenting user-visible changes

### Code Review Standards

- All changes require peer review before merge
- Reviewers must verify:
  - Constitution compliance (principles I–V)
  - Test coverage meets ≥90% threshold
  - Accessibility requirements met (if UI changes)
  - Documentation updated (if behavior changes)
  - No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Constructive feedback required: identify issues and suggest alternatives, not just block

### Security Practices

- No secrets (API keys, credentials, tokens) in source code or configuration files committed to version control
- User input must be validated and sanitized server-side
- Authentication and authorization required for all data access endpoints
- Dependencies must be audited regularly for known vulnerabilities
- Security issues take priority over feature work and must be addressed immediately

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development Cycle

1. **Specification**: Create feature spec (spec.md) with user stories, requirements, success criteria
2. **Planning**: Generate implementation plan (plan.md) documenting technical approach
3. **Task Breakdown**: Decompose plan into actionable tasks (tasks.md) organized by user story priority
4. **Test-First Development**: Write tests for highest priority user story (P1), verify they fail
5. **Implementation**: Implement minimum code to pass tests for that user story
6. **Independent Validation**: Verify the user story works independently before moving to next priority
7. **Incremental Delivery**: Repeat cycle for P2, P3... each story should be independently deliverable

### Branch & Commit Strategy

- Feature branches named `###-feature-name` matching spec directory
- Commits should be atomic (single logical change) and descriptive
- Commit messages explain "why" not "what" (code shows what changed)
- Squash commits discouraged—preserve development history for learning

### Quality Gates

Before merging any feature:

- All tests pass (unit, integration, contract)
- Test coverage ≥90% for touched code
- No linting or formatting violations
- Accessibility validation complete (if UI changes)
- Documentation updated
- Feature independently validated against success criteria

## Governance

### Amendment Process

1. Proposed changes documented with rationale and impact analysis
2. Review by team with focus on maintaining constitutional integrity
3. Update constitution with version bump following semantic versioning:
   - **MAJOR**: Backward incompatible principle removal or redefinition
   - **MINOR**: New principle added or material expansion of guidance
   - **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic refinements
4. Update all dependent templates (plan, spec, tasks) to maintain consistency
5. Communicate changes to all contributors

### Compliance Review

- Every pull request must verify compliance with all principles
- When principles conflict with deadlines, document the tradeoff explicitly and commit to remediation timeline
- Complexity violations (e.g., adding unnecessary abstraction, violating DRY inappropriately) must be justified in writing
- Constitution supersedes individual preferences—team consistency over personal style

### Living Document

This constitution evolves with the project. When principles prove impractical or new needs emerge:

- Propose amendments through standard process
- Version changes track evolution
- Prior versions retained for historical context
