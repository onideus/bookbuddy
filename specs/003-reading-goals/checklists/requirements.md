# Specification Quality Checklist: Reading Goals Tracker

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality ✅
- Spec focuses on user goals, behavior, and value proposition
- No technical implementation details (no mention of specific frameworks, databases, or code structure)
- Language is accessible to business stakeholders
- All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

### Requirement Completeness ✅
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All 15 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous
- Success criteria include measurable metrics (time limits, percentages, capacity numbers)
- Success criteria avoid implementation details and focus on user-facing outcomes
- Three prioritized user stories with detailed acceptance scenarios
- Six edge cases identified covering boundary conditions
- Scope is clear: goal creation, progress tracking, editing/deletion
- Key entities defined with relationships

### Feature Readiness ✅
- Functional requirements map to acceptance criteria in user stories
- User scenarios cover: creating goals (P1), viewing goals (P2), editing/deleting (P3)
- Success criteria are verifiable: response times, accuracy rates, capacity limits
- No technical leakage detected

## Notes

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is ready for the next phase:
- Run `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear and complete
