# Tasks: Reading Journey Tracker

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-track-reading/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Automated tests are MANDATORY. Define unit, integration, and contract coverage before implementation and ensure they fail prior to code changes (red-green-refactor).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions
- Include associated spec/task IDs, documentation updates, and accessibility evidence where applicable

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `web/src/`, `services/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- Setup (Phase 1) must complete before Foundational (Phase 2).
- Foundational tasks block all user stories (Phases 3‚Äì5).
- User Story phases can proceed sequentially or in parallel once Foundational complete, but US1 is required for MVP.
- Polish phase depends on desired user stories reaching completion.

### User Story Dependencies

- User Story 1 (P1) ‚Üí No dependency (baseline).
- User Story 2 (P2) ‚Üí Depends on US1 for shared components/data.
- User Story 3 (P3) ‚Üí Depends on US1 for list infrastructure; can proceed parallel with US2 after Foundational.

### Within Each User Story

- Author tests first (fail) before implementation.
- Data models and repositories before API handlers.
- API handlers before UI integration.
- UX validation and analytics instrumentation after functional components complete.

### Parallel Opportunities

- Setup tasks marked [P] T004‚ÄìT005 can run concurrently.
- Contract/unit tests (T014‚ÄìT016, T026‚ÄìT028, T036‚ÄìT038) can run in parallel per story.
- UI component builds (T020‚ÄìT023, T031‚ÄìT034, T041‚ÄìT044) can be split across engineers after shared state resolved.

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Tests
Task: "T014 [P] [US1] Write Vitest unit tests for reading list state manager in web/tests/unit/features/reading-journey/state/readingListState.test.ts"
Task: "T015 [P] [US1] Implement contract tests for GET /readers/{readerId}/reading-entries in services/tests/contract/reading-journey/listReadingEntries.test.ts"

# Implementation
Task: "T020 [US1] Build UI status tabs and lists in web/src/features/reading-journey/pages/DashboardPage.ts"
Task: "T021 [US1] Implement add-book form component with validation in web/src/features/reading-journey/components/AddBookForm.ts"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Setup and Foundational phases.
2. Deliver User Story 1 end-to-end (API + UI + analytics + a11y).
3. Validate with automated tests and UX sign-off.
4. Ship MVP with reading pipeline functionality.

### Incremental Delivery

1. MVP (US1) ‚Üí deploy once stable.
2. Layer in progress tracking (US2) with independent release toggle.
3. Add ratings/reflections (US3) once prior stories validated.
4. Polish phase addresses performance, observability, and documentation across stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

1. Team completes Phases 1‚Äì2 together.
2. Post-foundation, split by story:
   - Engineer A: US1 UI and state.
   - Engineer B: US1 API and data access.
   - Engineer C: US2 progress tracking components.
   - Engineer D: US3 ratings features.
3. Reconvene during Polish phase for cross-cutting validation.

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable, fully tested, and UX validated
- Verify tests fail before implementing (red), pass after implementation (green), then refactor
- Commit after each task or logical group referencing spec/task IDs
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence, undocumented design deviations
