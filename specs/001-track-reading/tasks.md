# Tasks: Reading Journey Tracker

**Feature**: Reading Journey Tracker  
**Branch**: 001-track-reading  
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-track-reading/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/openapi.yaml

**Tests**: TDD approach MANDATORY (QT-006). Write tests first, validate they fail (red), implement to pass (green), refactor while keeping tests green.

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Per plan.md structure:
- **Backend**: `backend/src/`, `backend/tests/`, `backend/migrations/`
- **Frontend**: `frontend/src/`, `frontend/tests/`
- **Shared**: `shared/contracts/`, `shared/constants.js`

- [ ] T136 Create deployment checklist from quickstart.md for staging/production environments

**Checkpoint**: Feature complete, tested, documented, and ready for deployment üéâ

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Scope (Recommended First Delivery)

**Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (User Story 1 only)**

This provides a complete, testable, deployable increment:
- Users can add books
- Users can organize books into TO_READ, READING, FINISHED
- Users can move books between statuses
- Users can filter by status
- Full test coverage
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- Production ready

**Benefits**:
- Validates core value proposition
- Establishes infrastructure for remaining stories
- Early user feedback
- Reduced risk

### Incremental Delivery

After MVP:
- **Iteration 2**: Add Phase 4 (User Story 2 - Progress Notes)
- **Iteration 3**: Add Phase 5 (User Story 3 - Ratings)
- **Iteration 4**: Add Phase 6 (Polish & optimization)

Each iteration is independently testable and deployable.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Story Dependencies

```text
Phase 1 (Setup)
     ‚Üì
Phase 2 (Foundational) ‚Üê BLOCKING: Must complete before user stories
     ‚Üì
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Phase 3 (US1 - Organize Pipeline) ‚Üê MVP ‚Üê No dependencies, can start immediately
     ‚îÇ   
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Phase 4 (US2 - Track Progress) ‚Üê Depends on US1 (requires READING books to exist)
     ‚îÇ   
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Phase 5 (US3 - Rate & Reflect) ‚Üê Depends on US1 (requires FINISHED books to exist)
          ‚Üì
     Phase 6 (Polish) ‚Üê Depends on all user stories
```

**Key Insights**:
- US1 is the MVP and has no dependencies on other stories
- US2 and US3 can run in parallel after US1 is complete (they don't depend on each other)
- Phase 6 should only start after all user stories are validated

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: Tasks T003-T013 can run in parallel (marked with [P])

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- T015, T018-T023, T027-T029 can run in parallel after T014, T017, T024-T025 are complete

**Phase 3 (US1)**:
- Tests T031-T042: All can run in parallel (different test files)
- Models T043-T046: All can run in parallel (different model files)
- Routes T052 can run in parallel with T051, T053
- Frontend T055-T056, T057 can run in parallel
- Frontend components T059-T061 can run in parallel after T058

**Phase 4 (US2)**:
- Tests T068-T075 can run in parallel
- T076 (model), T079 (schemas), T081 (route), T083-T084 (frontend) can run in parallel

**Phase 5 (US3)**:
- Tests T093-T099 can run in parallel
- T105, T108, T112 can run in parallel with other tasks in same phase

**Phase 6 (Polish)**:
- T118-T119, T121-T122, T125, T127-T130 can run in parallel
