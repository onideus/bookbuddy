# Specification Quality Checklist: Book Information Search

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Updated**: 2025-10-29 (Post-Codex Review)
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## ✅ Architectural Review Complete - All Decisions Approved

**GPT-5 (Codex) identified 4 critical architectural issues - ALL RESOLVED with approved decisions:**

1. ✅ Data model redesign approved (per-user overrides)
2. ✅ Infrastructure approved (Docker Compose for Redis)
3. ✅ Traffic revised (<10 concurrent users, free tier sufficient)
4. ✅ Cache TTLs set (Redis 12h, PostgreSQL 30 days)

See: [CODEX_ARCHITECTURAL_REVIEW.md](../CODEX_ARCHITECTURAL_REVIEW.md)

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - *Architectural decisions separated*

## Critical Issues Identified (Codex Review)

### Showstoppers

1. **Data Model** ❌ **BLOCKER**
   - **Issue**: Current shared `books` table causes user data leakage
   - **Impact**: One user's edits corrupt data for all users
   - **Resolution**: FR-015 added - per-user overrides architecture
   - **Status**: Requires data model redesign before implementation

2. **Rate Limiting** ❌ **BLOCKER**
   - **Issue**: Free tier (1,000 req/day) cannot support SC-005 (100 concurrent users)
   - **Impact**: Feature will fail immediately under realistic load
   - **Resolution**: FR-018 added - multi-layer caching (Redis + PostgreSQL)
   - **Status**: Requires infrastructure provisioning (Redis)

### High Priority Issues

3. **Duplicate Detection** ⚠️ **HIGH**
   - **Issue**: Current uniqueness strategy insufficient
   - **Impact**: Users can add duplicate books, poor data quality
   - **Resolution**: FR-019 added - ISBN-first with fuzzy matching fallback
   - **Status**: Requires implementation changes

4. **Provenance Tracking** ⚠️ **HIGH**
   - **Issue**: No audit trail to measure SC-007 (95% accuracy)
   - **Impact**: Cannot validate accuracy or refresh stale data
   - **Resolution**: FR-020 added - metadata sources table
   - **Status**: Requires new database table

## Updated Specification Metrics

**Before Codex Review**:
- Functional Requirements: 13
- Success Criteria: 7
- Edge Cases: 7
- Total Word Count: ~1,200

**After Codex Review**:
- Functional Requirements: 21 (+8)
- Success Criteria: 10 (+3)
- Edge Cases: 13 (+6)
- New Sections: Architectural Decisions, Assumptions, Dependencies, Risks, Implementation Phases
- Total Word Count: ~3,800 (+216%)

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Review (Updated)
- Specification still focuses on user needs and business value
- Technical decisions documented in separate "Architectural Decisions" section
- No specific implementation details in functional requirements
- All mandatory sections completed with expanded coverage

### Requirement Completeness Review (Updated)
- **21 functional requirements** (13 original + 8 from Codex)
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- Success criteria expanded from 7 to 10, categorized by User Experience, Performance/Reliability, Data Quality
- **13 edge cases** including 6 critical ones from Codex (quota exhaustion, cache failures, data leakage)
- Dependencies section added: External services, infrastructure, libraries
- Assumptions section added: 7 documented assumptions
- Risks section added: 9 risks with severity/likelihood/mitigation

### Feature Readiness Review (Updated)
- Each functional requirement verifiable through acceptance testing
- User scenarios unchanged (still cover complete journey)
- Success criteria mapped to new architectural requirements
- **Architectural decisions section** separates technical patterns from requirements
- **Implementation phases** defined: MVP, Enhancements, Optimization

## Decision Points - ALL RESOLVED ✅

All required decisions have been made and approved:

1. **Infrastructure Budget**: ✅ **APPROVED**
   - Redis via Docker Compose
   - Google Books API free tier (sufficient for <10 users)
   - Cost: $0/month

2. **Data Model Migration**: ✅ **APPROVED**
   - Per-user overrides architecture approved
   - New tables: book_editions, book_metadata_sources, reading_entries_overrides
   - No backfill required (database will be reset before production)

3. **Scope Confirmation**: ✅ **APPROVED**
   - Phase 1 (MVP) - Full feature with all critical fixes
   - Cache TTLs: Redis 12h, PostgreSQL 30 days
   - Cover image: Hot-linking for MVP

4. **Traffic Assumptions**: ✅ **REVISED**
   - Maximum 10 concurrent users (not 100)
   - ~100 searches/day (~3,000/month)
   - Free tier sufficient

## Overall Status

**READY FOR PLANNING** ✅

The specification is **complete and approved** with all critical issues resolved:

- ✅ **Data model** redesign approved (per-user overrides)
- ✅ **Rate limiting** resolved (low traffic + caching)
- ✅ **Duplicate detection** strategy approved (ISBN-first + fuzzy)
- ✅ **Provenance tracking** approved (metadata sources table)
- ✅ **Infrastructure** approved (Docker Compose for Redis)
- ✅ **Cache TTLs** set (Redis 12h, PostgreSQL 30 days)
- ✅ **Scope** confirmed (Phase 1 MVP)

**Next Steps**:
1. ✅ Architectural review complete
2. ✅ All decisions approved
3. **→ Proceed to `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning**

**Status**: Ready to move forward with implementation planning.
