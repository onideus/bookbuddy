# Tasks: Book Information Search

**Feature**: 002-book-api-search | **Branch**: `002-book-api-search`
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-book-api-search/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úì, spec.md ‚úì, research.md ‚úì, data-model.md ‚úì, contracts/ ‚úì

**Tests**: This feature follows TDD approach with ‚â•90% coverage target (QT-001). Tests are written first, verified to fail (red), then implementation makes them pass (green), followed by refactoring.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3).

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

This is a web application with backend API + frontend UI:
- Backend: `backend/src/`, `backend/tests/`
- Frontend: `frontend/src/`, `frontend/tests/`
- Infrastructure: `docker-compose.yml`, `backend/migrations/`

---

- [ ] T015 [P] Create backend/tests/unit/services/book-search/normalizer.test.js with tests for Google Books and Open Library format normalization
- [ ] T016 Create backend/src/lib/metrics.js extensions for search metrics: provider_latency_ms, cache_hit_rate, circuit_breaker_state, duplicate_detection_accuracy

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Quick Book Addition via Search (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Users can search for books by title/author/ISBN and auto-populate metadata, reducing manual entry time by 60% (SC-004)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional - users can search for books, see cached results within 3s, and auto-populate metadata

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Search Refinement and Manual Override (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Users can refine broad search results with filters and manually edit auto-populated fields for incomplete/incorrect data

**Independent Test**: Search for "Smith" (broad query), apply year filter "2020-2023", receive refined results, select a book, edit page count from auto-populated 350 to actual 342, verify override is saved per user

- [ ] T049 [US2] Add user override indicators in frontend showing which fields differ from canonical data (e.g., italic text, "edited by you" tooltip)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently - users can search broadly, refine with filters, and apply personal overrides without affecting other users

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Handling No Results and Manual Entry (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Users have a clear path forward when search returns no results, allowing manual book entry with option to retry search later

**Independent Test**: Search for nonexistent book "My Unpublished Memoir 2025", receive "No results found" message with "Add Manually" button, click button, fill in title and author, save successfully, later edit book and see "Retry Search" option

### Tests for User Story 3 (TDD: Write FIRST, verify FAIL)

- [ ] T055 [US3] Update frontend/src/components/BookForm/AddBookForm to support manual entry mode with required fields only (title, author minimum per FR-007)
- [ ] T056 [US3] Create GET /api/books/:bookId/search-suggestions endpoint in backend/src/api/routes/books.js that retries external search using existing book title + author
- [ ] T057 [US3] Add "Retry External Search" button in frontend book edit view for manually-entered books (checking if book_metadata_sources is empty)
- [ ] T058 [US3] Create frontend workflow for retry search: call GET /api/books/:bookId/search-suggestions, display results, allow user to merge metadata with existing manual entry

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional - users can search, refine, override, handle no results, and manually enter books

---

## Phase 6: Duplicate Detection (Critical - Addresses Codex Issue #3)

**Purpose**: Prevent duplicate books using ISBN-first strategy with fuzzy matching fallback (FR-019, SC-010)

- [ ] T059 Create backend/src/services/book-search/duplicate-detector.js with checkDuplicate(bookData) method implementing ISBN-first strategy

- [ ] T064 Add duplicate response handling: return 409 Conflict with {duplicate: true, matchType: 'isbn'|'fuzzy', confidence: 0.0-1.0, existingBook, actions: ['use_existing', 'create_anyway', 'merge']}
- [ ] T065 Create frontend/src/components/BookSearch/DuplicateWarning.jsx modal showing existing book details, confidence score, action buttons
- [ ] T066 Update frontend/src/services/bookSearchApi.js to handle 409 responses and trigger DuplicateWarning modal
- [ ] T067 Add force parameter to POST /api/books/from-search allowing user to bypass duplicate detection if force=true

---

## Phase 7: Open Library Fallback Provider (Enhancement)

- [ ] T072 Update cache keys in backend/src/services/book-search/cache-manager.js to include provider name (e.g., "search:1984:google_books" vs "search:1984:open_library")

---

## Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories and ensure production readiness

- [ ] T073 [P] Add comprehensive error handling in backend/src/services/book-search/index.js for all edge cases from spec.md (quota exhaustion, Redis unavailable, slow network)
- [ ] T074 [P] Implement graceful degradation: when Redis unavailable, skip to PostgreSQL L2 cache; when both unavailable, go directly to API with circuit breaker
- [ ] T075 [P] Add structured logging for all search operations with correlation IDs for request tracing
- [ ] T076 [P] Create backend health check endpoint GET /api/health/search returning Redis status, PostgreSQL cache status, circuit breaker state, provider quota remaining
- [ ] T077 [P] Implement metrics collection in backend/src/lib/metrics.js for SC-007 (95% accuracy), SC-008 (70% cache hit rate), SC-009 (<1% false positives)
- [ ] T078 [P] Add accessibility improvements: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation (Tab/Enter), screen reader announcements for search results, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (QT-005)
- [ ] T079 [P] Add internationalization support: UTF-8 encoding, multi-language search queries, RTL layout CSS for Arabic/Hebrew (FR-017)
- [ ] T080 [P] Create backend/tests/e2e/book-search.spec.js with Playwright covering complete user journeys for all 3 user stories
- [ ] T081 [P] Performance optimization: implement debounce (300ms) on search input, lazy loading for results, image lazy loading for covers
- [ ] T082 Update quickstart.md with any deviations from planned setup (if any)
- [ ] T083 Run through quickstart.md validation: Docker up, migration, dependencies, manual tests, automated tests
- [ ] T084 [P] Code cleanup: remove console.logs, add JSDoc comments, ensure consistent error handling, follow project style guide
- [ ] T085 [P] Security hardening: sanitize search queries for SQL injection, validate all inputs, implement rate limiting headers, add CORS configuration
- [ ] T086 Update CLAUDE.md if any new patterns or technologies were added during implementation

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup (T001-T006) - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (T007-T016) - Core MVP functionality
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational (T007-T016) - Can run in parallel with US1 but typically sequential
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational (T007-T016) - Can run in parallel with US1/US2 but typically sequential
- **Duplicate Detection (Phase 6)**: Depends on User Story 1 (T017-T037) - Critical enhancement
- **Open Library Fallback (Phase 7)**: Depends on Foundational (T007-T016) - Can develop in parallel with user stories
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
  - **CRITICAL**: This is the MVP - delivers immediate value (SC-004: 60% time reduction)
  - All tests (T017-T021) can run in parallel (different files)
  - Models (T022-T024) can run in parallel
  - Frontend components (T032-T034) can run in parallel

- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 but independently testable
  - Adds filters and overrides without breaking US1 functionality
  - All tests (T038-T040) can run in parallel

- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Handles edge case of no results
  - Fallback scenario that doesn't block core search functionality
  - Tests (T050-T051) can run in parallel

### Within Each User Story

**TDD Flow (CRITICAL)**:
1. **Tests FIRST**: Write all tests for the user story, verify they FAIL (red)
2. **Models**: Create data models needed for the story
3. **Services**: Implement business logic
4. **Endpoints/UI**: Wire up API routes and frontend components
5. **Tests PASS**: Verify all tests now pass (green)
6. **Refactor**: Clean up code while keeping tests green

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: T002 and T003 can run in parallel (different files)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- T008, T009, T010, T011 (models) can all run in parallel (different files)
- T015 (normalizer test) can run in parallel with models

**Phase 3 (User Story 1)**:
- Tests: T017, T018, T019, T020, T021 all parallel (different test files)
- Providers: T022 can run while T023-T024 are in progress
- Frontend components: T032, T033, T034 all parallel (different component files)

**Phase 4 (User Story 2)**:
- Tests: T038, T039, T040 all parallel
- T041, T045 can run in parallel (different concerns)

**Phase 5 (User Story 3)**:

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only) - RECOMMENDED

**Goal**: Deliver core search functionality as fast as possible for validation

1. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T006) - Docker, dependencies, migration
2. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T007-T016) - Models, base provider, metrics
3. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T017-T037) - Full search with Google Books
4. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 6: Duplicate Detection (T059-T067) - Critical for data quality
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**:
   - Run all tests (unit, integration, E2E)
   - Manual testing per quickstart.md
   - Verify SC-001 (book addition <30s), SC-002 (90% searches <3s), SC-004 (60% time reduction)
6. Demo to stakeholders, gather feedback
7. Deploy to staging/production if ready

**Estimated effort**: ~60-70% of total tasks, delivers 80% of user value

### Incremental Delivery (All User Stories)

**Goal**: Add enhancements in priority order without breaking MVP

1. ‚úÖ Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. ‚úÖ Add User Story 1 + Duplicate Detection ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **Deploy MVP!**
3. Add User Story 2 (Filters + Overrides) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy enhancement
4. Add User Story 3 (No Results + Manual Entry) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy fallback handling
5. Add Phase 7 (Open Library Fallback) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy resilience improvement
6. Add Phase 8 (Polish) ‚Üí Final validation ‚Üí Deploy production-ready version

**Each phase adds value without breaking previous functionality**

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 2-3 developers working concurrently:

1. **All team**: Complete Setup + Foundational together (T001-T016)
2. **Once Foundational is done**:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 backend (T017-T029)
   - Developer B: User Story 1 frontend (T030-T037)
   - Developer C: Duplicate Detection (T059-T067)
3. **After User Story 1 complete**:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (T038-T049)
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (T050-T058)
   - Developer C: Open Library Fallback (T068-T072)
4. **Final integration**: All team on Phase 8 Polish (T073-T086)

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies within same phase - run in parallel for speed
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability and independent testing
- **TDD approach**: Write tests first (red), implement to pass (green), refactor - per QT-001
- **Commit strategy**: Commit after each task or logical group (e.g., all models for a story)
- **Stop at checkpoints**: Validate each user story independently before proceeding
- **Cache TTLs**: Redis 12h, PostgreSQL 30 days per user approval
- **Traffic assumptions**: <10 concurrent users, ~100 searches/day, free tier sufficient
- **Avoid**:
  - Vague tasks without file paths
  - Cross-story dependencies that break independence
  - Skipping tests (TDD is required per QT-001)
  - Direct edits to canonical Book records (use ReadingEntryOverride instead)

---

**Total Tasks**: 86 tasks across 8 phases
**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-3 + Phase 6 (T001-T037 + T059-T067) = ~50 tasks
**Parallel Opportunities**: ~35 tasks marked [P] can run concurrently
**Estimated MVP Delivery**: 2-3 weeks for single developer, 1-2 weeks for team of 3

**Ready to implement**: `/speckit.implement` command can now execute tasks in dependency order
